## GitHub Cheatsheet

inital copy of repo - `git clone <url>`
update local copy of repo - `git pull origin <branchname> (normally master)`
check current branch name - `git branch`
create new branch - `git checkout -b "<branchname>"`
stage changes - `git add .`
commit changes - `git commit -m "<message>"`
push changes - `git push origin <branchname>`

## Workflow

1. pick feature to implement (trello)
2. update your local git repo
3. create a new branch for your feature
4. implement the feature
5. add, commit and push your feature to github (your new branch)
6. open a pull request - someone else will review your code and merge it in
